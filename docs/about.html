                    Hi, my name is <span>Ana</span> and I’m a designer and researcher currently based in Lisbon. 
                    I got my Bachelor’s degree in Engineering Physics, but I sought to have a move direct sociocultural 
                    impact and switched fields for my Master’s in Communication Design. As both a <span>scientist</span> 
                    and a <span>designer</span>, I came to understand both these aspects not as opposites, but 
                    complementary — two different sides to the same pursuit of knowledge coin. With this in mind, 
                    I have always nurtured and developed many inter- and <span>multidisciplinary</span> interests, 
                    such as art and design philosophy, web and editorial design, and creative coding. I have also 
                    recently been experimenting with some musical endeavours. Currently, in between lecturing, 
                    learning, and creating, I am PhD student researching ways to create a framework for 
                    <span>design activism</span> through an ethical deliberation process that is specifically 
                    anchored in intersectional queer/feminist ways of knowing. I am also very interested in exploring 
                    possible materializations of this type of discourse so if you have any thoughts about any of this 
                    I’d really love to <span>hear from you</span>. I love to debate and share ideas and skills so if you think we 
                    might have something to teach and learn from each other, please hit me up <span>:)</span>

                    I am a 26-year-old cisgender (to be completely honest, the gender journey is not really complete
yet but we’re going with that at the moment) white queer neurodivergent able-bodied woman. My preferred pronouns are she/they. I am living in Lisbon, Portugal at the time of publishing, but I was born in the United States of America where I lived for two-and-a-half years. I come from a middle-class background, my education has been primarily anglo- and lusophone and I have always lived in urban centers. Even though most of my family is catholic, I do not subscribe to any particular religion or creed.<br><br>
                    These are my biases.<br>
